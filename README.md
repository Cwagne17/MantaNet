## Author Note

The intention of this project is gain a deeper understanding of Network Security, Docker, and Machine Learning while hopefully developing a useful and unique tool that may contribute to the Open Source Community. As a fun aside, the requirements were developed through conversational brainstorming with ChatGPT. The following is a summary of the requirements and recommendations that were determined.

## Description

MantaNet is an open-source Docker network traffic analysis tool that leverages machine learning techniques to provide insights into network metrics, anomalies, and patterns within Docker container environments. With its focus on the graceful and powerful Manta, it enables users to monitor, analyze, and visualize network traffic for improved security and performance.

## Key Features

1. Capturing and analyzing network traffic within Docker containers and networks.
2. Applying machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and performance analysis.
3. Visualizing network traffic patterns and metrics in a user-friendly and interactive manner.
4. Integrating with Docker APIs and external data sources for additional context and information.
5. Customized reporting and alerting mechanisms for actionable insights.

## Recommended Tools for Testing

- Docker: The Docker platform to set up and manage containerized environments.
- Packet Capture Tools: Tools like tcpdump or Wireshark to capture and inspect network traffic within Docker containers. `tcpdump` | `Wireshark`
- Python Testing Frameworks: Testing frameworks like pytest or unittest for creating test cases and automating the testing process. `pytest` | `unittest`
- Mocking Libraries: Libraries like unittest.mock or pytest-mock to create mock objects for isolating dependencies during testing. `unittest.mock` | `pytest-mock`
- Load Testing Tools: Tools like Locust or Apache JMeter to simulate high traffic loads and assess the performance of your Docker network traffic analysis tool. `Locust` | `Apache JMeter`

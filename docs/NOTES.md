# Notes

Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) - process of detecting, recording, and analyzing communication patterns in order to detect and respond to security menace, even when messages are encrypted. [1]

NTA Mechanisms:

- Self-similarity and Transform-Expand Sample (TES)
- Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
- **Flow Analysis: used for detecting anomalies in network traffic** [1.4][2]
- User Intention-Based Traffic Dependence Analysis
- **Traffic Anomalies Detection Algorithms: flow outliers (statistical approach, pattern mining), trajectory outliers.** [1.15]
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS): signature-based, anomaly-based, hybrid.

Four steps of machine learning:

1. Identify classes from training data.
2. Create a model using the training dataset that is being trained by ML algorithm.
3. Use the trained model to classify the unknown data and makes a prediction.
4. The prediction is evaluated for accuracy. If the accuracy is not acceptable, the Machine Learning
algorithm is trained repeatedly with an augmented training data set.
